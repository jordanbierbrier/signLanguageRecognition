**Computer Vision** + **Machine Learning** models for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) letters in real-time using a webcam.  
Implemented three approaches:
- ðŸ§  **HOG + SVM**
- ðŸ§  **SIFT + Bag of Words + SVM**
- ðŸ§  **ResNet-50 Transfer Learning**

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jordanbierbrier/signLanguageRecognition.git
    cd signLanguageRecognition
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run real-time prediction:**
    ```bash
    # Choose one of the models:
    python predict_hog.py
    python predict_sift.py
    python predict_resnet.py
    ```

4. **Webcam Controls during Prediction:**

| Key | Action |
|:---|:---|
| `b` | Capture background (must press for first prediction) |
| `space` | Add space to the predicted word |
| `s` | Toggle displaying current word |
| `backspace` | Delete last predicted letter |
| `r` | Reset the entire word |
| `ESC` | Exit program |


## ðŸ“Š Results and Observations
- **HOG + SVM** provided a good tradeoff between speed and accuracy for real-time use.
- **SIFT features** achieved high validation accuracy but were unstable in live prediction (sensitive to small hand changes).
- **ResNet-50** transfer learning underperformed due to a small dataset and domain difference from ImageNet.
